# Java-POTS-Project
Java Procurement Order Tracking System
Description
POTS is a console‑based Java application that automates and manages the full lifecycle of purchase orders. It provides a menu‑driven interface for multiple user roles to handle inventory, sales, requisitions, orders, and payments—using simple text files for data storage.
